# User authentication system

#### Welcome to User authentication system, an open-source login system using Firebase!

### What is this website for?
I wanted to make a responsive website that contains an authentication module using Firebase, where users can create an account login/logout and update profile info.

### Why did you create this website?
It's a template for an authentication system that i intend to use in future projects.

### What did you use to build this website?
I used React, Material-UI as a design library, and Firebase for autentication and data storage. I'm planning on adding some advanced features like login using google or facebook accounts etc...
